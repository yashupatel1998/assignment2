    AI-managed smart devices create a channel between various components like appliances and end-users to react to any hazard or emergency. This information layer, which was developed because of the widespread implementation of smart meters and sensors, enables data gathering, storing, and interpretation. And by having efficient prediction capabilities, AI can be used to boost market forecasting and utilisation consumption.
